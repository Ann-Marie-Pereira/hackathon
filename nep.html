        <h1>URANUS</h1>
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in our solar system, and it's classified as an ice giant. Here are some key characteristics of Uranus:

            1. *Composition:* Uranus, like Neptune, is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, but it's often referred to as an "ice giant" because it also contains significant amounts of water, ammonia, and methane in its atmosphere.
            
            2. *Appearance:* Uranus is known for its unique feature: it rotates on its side. This means its rotation axis is almost parallel to its orbital plane, causing it to appear to roll along its orbit rather than spin like most planets. It's also often described as having a pale blue-green color due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere.
            
            3. *Rings:* Uranus has a system of faint, narrow rings, which were first discovered in 1977. These rings are much less prominent than Saturn's, but they are made up of small particles and dust.
            
            4. *Moons:* Uranus has a total of 27 known natural moons. The five largest moons are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. These moons vary in size and appearance and were named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
            
            5. *Discovery:* Uranus was discovered by German-born British astronomer Sir William Herschel in 1781. Its discovery marked a significant milestone in the understanding of our solar system, as it was the first planet to be discovered with a telescope.
            
            6. *Exploration:* Uranus has been visited by a spacecraft only once, and that was the Voyager 2 probe in 1986. Voyager 2 provided valuable data and images of the planet and its moons.
            
            Uranus remains an intriguing and relatively unexplored world in our solar system, known for its unusual rotation and its distinct pale blue-green appearance.</p>
