        <h1>MERCURY</h1>
        <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system and is also the smallest of the eight major planets. Here are some key facts about Mercury:

            Size and Composition: Mercury is approximately 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles) in diameter, making it only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. It is composed primarily of rock and metal and lacks a substantial atmosphere.
            
            Distance from the Sun: Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles), making it the closest planet to the Sun. Because of its proximity, it experiences extreme temperature variations, with surface temperatures ranging from scorching hot to extremely cold.
            
            Rotation and Day-Night Cycle: Mercury has a slow rotation, taking about 59 Earth days to complete one rotation on its axis. However, its day-night cycle is unique; a day on Mercury (from sunrise to sunrise) takes approximately 176 Earth days due to its slow rotation.
            
            Surface Features: Mercury's surface is marked by numerous impact craters, similar to the Moon's surface. It also has extensive plains, cliffs, and ridges. One of its most prominent features is the Caloris Basin, a large impact crater.
            
            Lack of Atmosphere: Mercury's thin and tenuous atmosphere consists mainly of trace amounts of helium, hydrogen, and small quantities of other elements. It is incapable of supporting human life and does not provide significant protection from solar radiation or meteoroids.
            
            Extreme Temperatures: Due to its lack of atmosphere, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations. Surface temperatures can soar as high as 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) on the day side, while on the night side, temperatures can plummet to around -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit).
            
            Missions to Mercury: Several missions have been sent to study Mercury, including NASA's Mariner 10, which made multiple flybys in the 1970s, and the more recent MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) spacecraft, which orbited Mercury from 2011 to 2015. These missions have provided valuable insights into the planet's geology, surface composition, and magnetic field.
            
            Future Exploration: The European Space Agency (ESA) launched the BepiColombo mission in 2018, in collaboration with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). BepiColombo is a mission to Mercury that will study the planet in detail, including its surface, magnetic field, and composition.</p>
