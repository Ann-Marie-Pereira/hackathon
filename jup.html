        <h1>JUPITER</h1>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant, meaning it consists mostly of hydrogen and helium and lacks a solid surface. Here are some key facts about Jupiter:

            Size and Mass: Jupiter is approximately 11 times the diameter of Earth and more than 300 times more massive. Its immense size and mass make it the most massive planet in our solar system.
            
            Atmosphere: Jupiter has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, along with trace amounts of other gases, including methane, ammonia, water vapor, and more. The planet's atmosphere is known for its colorful bands and zones, which are caused by different wind speeds and chemical compositions at various altitudes.
            
            Great Red Spot: Jupiter is famous for the Great Red Spot, a massive storm system that has been raging for at least 350 years and is larger than Earth. This feature is a high-pressure anticyclonic storm and appears as a distinctive red, oval-shaped spot in Jupiter's southern hemisphere.
            
            Moons: Jupiter has a large number of moons, with over 80 confirmed to date. Some of the most well-known moons of Jupiter include Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system and even larger than the planet Mercury.
            
            Magnetic Field: Jupiter has an extremely powerful magnetic field, which is the strongest of any planet in our solar system. This magnetic field traps charged particles and creates intense radiation belts around the planet.
            
            Rings: Jupiter has a faint ring system, although it is not as prominent or extensive as Saturn's. The planet's rings are primarily composed of small dust particles and debris.
            
            Exploration: Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including the Pioneer and Voyager missions in the 1970s, the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s, and the Juno spacecraft, which arrived in 2016 and continues to study the planet's atmosphere and magnetic field.</p>
