        <h1>MARS</h1>
        <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. It's often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Here are some key features of Mars:

            1. Size: Mars is approximately half the size of Earth, with a diameter of about 6,779 kilometers (4,212 miles).
            
            2. Atmosphere: Mars has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. It lacks a protective ozone layer, making its surface more exposed to harmful solar radiation.
            
            3. Surface: Mars has a diverse landscape, including vast deserts, canyons, and the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. The planet also has a giant canyon system called Valles Marineris.
            
            4. Climate: Mars has extreme temperature variations, with average temperatures around -80 degrees Fahrenheit (-62 degrees Celsius). Surface conditions are harsh, with low air pressure and little moisture, making it inhospitable to human life.
            
            5. Moons: Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are irregularly shaped and likely captured asteroids.
            
            6. Exploration: Mars has been a major target for robotic exploration. Numerous missions, including the Mars rovers, orbiters, and landers, have been sent to study its geology, climate, and the potential for past or present life.
            
            7. Potential for Life: While no direct evidence of life has been found, Mars has geological features that suggest it may have had liquid water in the past. The search for signs of past or present life continues.
            
            8. Future Missions: Human missions to Mars are being planned by space agencies and private companies. These missions aim to establish a human presence on the planet, which presents significant engineering and logistical challenges.
            
            Mars remains a focal point for scientific research and exploration, as it holds clues about the history of our solar system and the possibility of life beyond Earth.</p>
