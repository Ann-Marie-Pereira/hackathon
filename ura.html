        <h1>NEPTUNE</h1>
        <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun in our solar system, located at an average distance of about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun. It's considered an ice giant, which means it has a thick atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of methane. This methane gives Neptune its distinctive deep blue color.

            Here are some key characteristics of Neptune:
            
            1. Size: Neptune has a diameter of approximately 49,244 kilometers (30,598 miles), making it the fourth-largest planet in the solar system by diameter, after Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.
            
            2. Atmosphere: Neptune's atmosphere is dynamic and features strong winds, with some of the fastest recorded winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 miles per hour). The atmosphere also contains various cloud layers, including clouds of methane, ammonia, and water vapor.
            
            3. Rings: Neptune has a system of faint, dark rings. These rings are made up of small particles and are much less prominent than the rings of Saturn.
            
            4. Moons: Neptune has a diverse group of 14 known moons, with the largest and most well-known being Triton. Triton is unique among large moons in the solar system because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune's gravity.
            
            5. Magnetic Field: Neptune has a strong and complex magnetic field that is tilted relative to its rotation axis. This magnetic field is believed to be generated by processes within the planet's deep interior.
            
            6. Exploration: The only spacecraft to have visited Neptune is NASA's Voyager 2, which flew by the planet in 1989. It provided valuable data and images of the planet and its moons.
            
            Neptune remains a fascinating and mysterious world, and there is still much to learn about this distant ice giant in our solar system.</p>
